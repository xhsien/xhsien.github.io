For my first coaster, I intended to give it a grey base and green marbled stripes (grey for Heizhima and green for Mocha), but it turns out to be entirely greyish...

My second coaster was supposed to be red base and white marbled stripes, but again...

As I still have some ingredients left, my partner get to try it later in the afternoon. She totally nailed it! Here is a picture of it with my buddy Mocha.

Heizhima doesn't seem very happy with the coaster I made for him.
