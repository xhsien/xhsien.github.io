Peanut cookie is my brother's favorite - he can probably finish one tin by himself. While I'm not that obsessed, I do have strong opinion on what's an ideal peanut cookie. It is soft instead of crunchy. When you bite into it, it melts in your mouth and release the wonderful roasted peanut aroma. Mild sweetness with a hint of saltiness - that's a peanut cookie you can't resist.

Here is the recipe I use. The total weight of the ingredients is about 1.5kg, and should be able to fill up 3 small tins.

## Ingredients

1. Lightly crushed roasted peanuts 500g
2. Plain flour 500g
3. Icing sugar 250g
4. Peanut oil 250g
5. Salt 2g
6. Egg x1

## Equipments

1. Large pan that can contain all the peanuts
2. Large bowl that can contain all the ingredients
3. Blender to blend the peanuts
4. Measuring spoon for consistent cookie size
5. Metal straw to poke the cookie
6. Brush to coat the cookies with egg wash
7. Oven, preheated at 170 degree
8. Baking paper, duh

## Steps

1. Add salt into the peanuts. Mix well.
2. Heat the peanuts on a large pan until fragrant. Keep stirring to prevent burn.
3. Blend the peanuts until fine.
4. Sift plain flour and icing sugar into a large bowl.
5. Add blended peanut into the large bowl. Mix well.
6. Add peanut oil into the large bowl. Mix well.
7. Scoop the cookie dough using a measuring spoon.
8. Roll each portion into a ball.
9. Poke the top of the ball lightly with a metal straw.
10. Brush each cookie with egg wash.
11. Bake in oven at 170 degree for 15 minutes.

## Personal Notes

For the egg wash, some recipes recommend using only the egg yolk. For experimental purpose, I tried one with egg yolks only, one with whole egg, and finally with no egg wash at all. While there are differences in the appearance, I don't find significant difference in texture and taste. So, I recommend using the whole egg to prevent waste, or simply remove the egg wash for a vegan friendly dessert!
