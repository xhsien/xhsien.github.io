## Personal Notes

1. Ring mould allows the cake to hold its shape better. Without the ring, the center of the cake rises the highest and cracks will form.
2. Slowly add in sugar while beating the egg whites. Sugar keeps the form of the meringue. Do not use icing sugar.
3. Beat the egg whites with high speed to form large bubble, then turn it to medium speed for a consistent meringue.
4. Use the folding technique when mixing the meringue and the batter. This prevents over-beating the egg whites.
5. Add in only 1/3 of the meringue and mix well, then only add in the remaining meringue. Otherwise it will be difficult to mix well.
6. Slowly pour the batter into the mould to release large air bubbles in the batter.
