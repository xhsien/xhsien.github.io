I started playing the piano when I was 10. Sadly, I didn't have a lot of interest in it, and stopped taking lessons shortly after passing grade 5. However, I do like to occasionally play the pieces I like, mostly theme songs from movies, animes and games. It feels different than simply listening. It feels more *personal*. When listening to a music, I'm receiving whatever the composer is trying to communicate. I feel the sorrow, the joy and the enthusiasm experienced by the protagonist. However, when I play it by myself, it feels like I *am* the protagonist.

As a working adult now, I want to re-learn the piano and be able to play it right - with the correct techniques and accurately expressing my thoughts and emotions. For that, I invested in a beginner digital piano, the [Casio CDP-S150](https://www.casio-intl.com/sg/en/emi/products/cdps150/). While I understand that a digital piano may limit the development of certain techniques, I think it should be fine for basic techniques and move on to a better piano afterwards. For lessons, I follow [Josh Wright](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp4DtLatjb5dBNHHYcvVXCw), a pianist Youtuber. He recommended several ways to [self-learn the piano](https://youtu.be/JWLMzWhOLp8), and I bought one of the recommended technique books. Then here comes the problem...

Even though I have a Computer Science background, I am quite confident that I am able to learn subjects such as physics, finance, psychology or history if I invest the time for it.
