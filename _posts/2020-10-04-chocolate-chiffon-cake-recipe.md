## Personal Notes

1. Water bath technique stabilizes oven temperature, and thus prevents cracks forming in the center.
2. Cocoa powder replaces 30% of the cake flour from the [basic recipe](https://xhsien.github.io/recipe/baking/cake/basic-chiffon-cake-recipe/).
3. Cocoa powder requires more liquid hence increases milk quantity.
