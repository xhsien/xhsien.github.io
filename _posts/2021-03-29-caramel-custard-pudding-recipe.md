I don't think I've ever tried a caramel custard pudding before, so I can't tell whether the outcome was authentic, but I liked it! The pudding is silky and rich, while the caramel gives it a nice sweet flavour with a hint of bitterness. It tastes magical.

## Ingredients

### Caramel

1. Water 30g
2. Sugar 55g
3. Water (to cool down the caramel) 30g

### Pudding

1. Eggs x2
2. Sugar 20g
3. Whipping cream 180g
4. Milk 190g

I use the [President Whipping Cream](https://presidentdairy.com.sg/whipping-cream-200ml/) which is exactly 180g, and you can easily find it in Fairprice.

## Steps

### Caramel

1. Add sugar and water in a pan.
2. Heat the sugar water mixture until brown.
3. Add water to cool down the caramel.
4. Pour the caramel evenly into 4 moulds.

### Pudding

1. Heat up whipping cream and milk in a pot until 80 degrees.
2. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and mix in sugar.
3. Pour milk mixture into the eggs very slowly while continue beating the eggs.
4. Filter the final mixture to remove the air bubbles.
5. Pour the mixture evenly into the previous 4 moulds.
6. Cover each mould with aluminium foil.
7. Bake in the oven at 150 degree for 40 minutes using the water bath technique.
8. Let it cool down completely and rest in fridge for about an hour before consumption.

## Personal Notes

When making caramel, you want to use a pot that heats evenly. Otherwise, some part will be burnt while the other part has not melted yet. You might think that stirring helps, but it's actually quite dangerous. First, the mixture can get really hot and you absolutely do not want to get splashed. Even if you are careful, if the mixture splashed and stick on the side of the pan it will get burnt too. For easier control, use low heat throughout the entire process.

The reason we pour the milk mixture slowly is because we do not want to cook the eggs. Once the eggs are cooked, the protein changed its form and can't coagulate the pudding anymore. An alternative is to wait until the milk mixture is cooled before adding into the eggs. What's the purpose of heating it, just to let it cool, then? The reason is to evaporate air bubbles that are trapped inside the mixture. If we do not remove the bubbles, tiny little holes will form around the pudding and affects its aesthetic.

I made 4 puddings and couldn't finish it on the day itself so I kept until the next day. The caramel becomes more watery, and the pudding can't hold its shape as good compared to the one before. So, my recommendation is to finish them as soon as possible.

## Final Result

I'm not sure how Mocha found out we made pudding but Mocha really enjoys it. Mocha suggests adding Matcha powder but I doubt that'll be good. On my second try I would probably do milk tea pudding though.
